      <h1><b>hello, my babyyy!</b></h1>
      <b>
        <p>first of all, happy valentines day to most prettiest girl! I actually wanted to tell you this personally, kaya nag insist talaga ako sumama sa'yo sa cvsu. but due to circumstances, I'll say it here nalang, but since gusto ko na special, I made effort nalang using mga natutunan ko sa specialized subject namin hehe. What I'll say here is purely out of my sincerity.</p>

        <p>so ayon, I'm getting confusion over us na nga, specifically sa label natin. I've grown attached sa'yo, to the point na you've become someone that I want to cherish, and umabot na rin sa point na natakot ako'ng mawala kung ano'ng meron sa atin. I'm really hoping for us. to break that confusion, I want to show my sincere and pure intentions for you, I've given a thought to make our label into the next level. HAJAHAHAHHA WOW</p>

        <p>baby, I'd like to pursue you. so if you'd allow me to do so, I'd be more than willing to do that. I'm willing to wait for us, let's take our time to know each other, ayoko naman na pumasok sa isip mo na sa una lang ako magaling. I'm willing to take any risk, if it means being with you, and having 'us' together. I'm quite persistent din, yk. I might make mistakes along the way, but I'll be the man who's willing to be better for you and for us, and grow along the process. I'm not saying these things out of infatuation, I sincerely want to express myself. I believe that 'love' is not a feeling, it is a commitment and a choice, so I've made my choice to pursue someone that I love and cherish. I don't have any much more to say, aside from how pretty you are and how precious you are to me, your eyes, smile and hair those appearance of yours that caught me, and your personality which caught me the most,I don't want to elaborate na HAAHAHAHHAA, basta I love your personality. goshhhh, ang dami ko pa'ng gusto sabihin e, ayaw lang ma blurt ng utak ko, pero ayon, I just want to sincerely express my feelings through this script.</p>

        <p>baby, with chance or no chance, I'm man enough to ask you. pwede ba kita'ng ligawan?</p>
